August 23rd 1883: 
Today I discouraged Millie from painting for the first time. It broke my heart, but I knew I had to do it. 
Constance and I had a proper conversation for the first time in months. 
She told me I was a bad influence on our daughter and have led our family to only hardship. 
I can't seem to bring myself to even look at Millie anymore, all I can think of is the pain I've put her and Constance through. 
The only important thing in my life was Millie, and yet I've failed her too. There's nothing left for me here. 
The only thing left that I can do for this family is to disappear.
