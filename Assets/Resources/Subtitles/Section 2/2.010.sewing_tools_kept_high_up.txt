Mother was so organized later in life. After father had disappeared she became distant and stern ... boxed herself up, 
just like how she boxed up the gowns she used to proudly flaunt. The last I remember she kept her sewing tools 
up high on a shelf. She said it was so I couldn't hurt myself, but I reckon it was because she didn't want me touching her things.
