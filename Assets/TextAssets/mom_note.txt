September 6th: 
It has been two days since David has gone missing, and although I contacted authorities to look for him, 
I know in my heart he has chosen to leave us behind. 
Although he never wanted this life, I thought he was willing to do anything to stay with me, with Millie, but I guess we were not enough. 
I cannot change the past. It's up to me to carry on now, if not for me, for Millie. 
I do not have the heart to tell her he left us.
My only wish is for Millie to live as normal of a life as I can provide for her. 
Of all the fears that have already succeeded, my greatest fear yet is to lose Millie as well.
