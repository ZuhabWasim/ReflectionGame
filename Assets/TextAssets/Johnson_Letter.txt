Dear Miss Everly,
Condolences on your mother’s passing, it must have been quite a long journey to come all the way down here for her funeral.
I know she didn't always show it, but I'm sure she would have been glad you were there. 
I shut off power to the house since I didn't know when you would arrive, now that you're the only one with attachment to the house.
The fusebox is located to the left of the fireplace, though I’m not sure what code you need to turn it back on. 
I’m sure you’ll figure it out. Now that the house is yours, I wish you the best. Sincerely, 
Johnson, your mothers caretaker
