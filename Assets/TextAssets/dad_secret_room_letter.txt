July 28th 1883: 
I don't know what I'm doing wrong. They say every artist has to better themselves, yet it seems my work is never improving… 
at least that's what the critics are saying about me. 
I feel like I keep hitting a new rock bottom with each failed gala I present my work at. 
It has been almost a year that we have been behind on payments and I fear we’ve dug ourselves a hole we can no longer get out of. 
I’ve poured my entire soul into my career, but I don't know how much more I can give. 
Constance won't even look at my face anymore, and I fear she's changed into someone I no longer recognize. 
I’m not confident that there is much hope left for our situation.
